# archiving-ms-links

this project tryes to archive microsoft quick links for the future...

this linkes lookes like

```http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=1337```

and are using 302 found http message to route to there destination. The link between LinkId and destination can change over time. in the proof-of-concept.csv file i have given some examples (made by a not as good as expected working curl bash script). Unfortunately i am not able to complete this listing due to my bad internet connection and lack of the  programming skills. It would be grate if someone with certain coding skills could write an appropriated piece of software and someone could run this regularly to get the an ms-links archive. Thanks

also this is a request for comments...
